# Variables Used
## user defined variables
gender = athlete sex</br>
height = athlete height in meters</br>
massBody = athlete body weight</br>

## derived variables
L_arm = total length of all the arm segments</br>
L_upperArm = length of the upper arm (shoulder joint to elbow)</br>
L_foreArm = length of the forearm (elbow to wrist)</br>
L_hand = length of the hand (wrist to fingertip)</br>

M_arm = total mass of all the arm segments</br>
M_upperArm = length of the upper arm (shoulder joint to elbow)</br>
M_foreArm = length of the forearm (elbow to wrist)</br>
M_hand = length of the hand (wrist to fingertip)</br>

## concerned variables
L_pec = anatomical insertion distance of the pectoralis major</br>
L_lat = anatomical insertion of the latissimus dorsi</br>

## major differentiating variables
A_pec = insertion angle of the pectoralis major when the arms are parallel to the ground</br>
A_lat = insertion angle of the latissimus dorsi when the arms are parallel to the ground</br>
PCSA_ratio = physiological cross-sectional area ratio (area of the latissimus dorsi / area of the pectoralis major)</br>
these three variables are the genetic identifiers of ring specialists and favorable genetics here acutely reduce the difficulty of the iron cross</br>

## physiological derivations
<i>all calculations took gender into account when calculating values</i>
the M series variables relating the mass of the arm segments were calculated using the Zatsiorsky-Seluyanov method with predetermined B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, and B<sub>2</sub> co-efficeients.
